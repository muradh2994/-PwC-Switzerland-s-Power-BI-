# Gender Diversity and Inclusion Analysis

## Introduction
This project is an initiative by PwC Switzerland in collaboration with our telecom client's Human Resources department, aimed at assessing and enhancing gender balance at the executive management level. Despite efforts to improve, progress has been stagnant, prompting a need for detailed analytics and strategic actions.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the underlying factors contributing to the lack of gender diversity progression and to provide actionable insights to achieve a more balanced and inclusive workplace, especially at higher management levels.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We have identified several KPIs to measure and track progress towards gender diversity and inclusion:

- **Gender Composition**: Number of men and women across different levels of the organization.
- **Promotion Rates**: Percentage of employees promoted, with a breakdown by gender.
- **Hiring Metrics**: Percentage of men and women hired within the reporting period.
- **Turnover Rates**: Overall turnover percentage and gender-specific turnover rates.
- **Performance Ratings**: Average performance ratings, segmented by gender.
