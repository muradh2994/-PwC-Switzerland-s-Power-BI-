- **Calls by Time**: Shows call volume distributed over different times of the day or days of the week.
- **Average Speed of Answer**: Calculates the average time taken by agents to answer calls.
- **Agent Performance Quadrant**: Visualizes each agent's average handle time against the number of calls they have answered.
