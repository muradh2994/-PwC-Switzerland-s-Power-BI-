- **Churn Rate**: The percentage of customers discontinuing their service over a specific period.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: The projected revenue a customer will generate during their relationship with the company.
- **Risk of Churn**: An index based on predictive analytics to identify customers likely to churn, considering various behavioral indicators.
- **Retention Rate by Cohort**: Measurement of customer retention across different groups, segmented by sign-up date, product type, or demographics.
- **Re-engagement Success Rate**: Effectiveness of targeted campaigns aimed at re-engaging customers who are considered at risk of churning.
